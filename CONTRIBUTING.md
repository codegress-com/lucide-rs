Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lucide Rust! 🎨

## 🎯 Important Note About Icons

**Icons in this library are automatically generated** from the upstream [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) project. We don't manually create or modify individual icon files, as they are synced and generated from the main Lucide icon set.

## 🤝 How You Can Contribute

We handle all the technical implementation and code maintenance. Your ideas, feedback, and issue reports are exactly what we need to make this project better!

### 🐛 Found a Bug?

Use our **[bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)** and include:

- **Framework** you're using (Leptos, Yew, Dioxus, Sycamore)
- **Version** of lucide-rs you're using
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual** behavior

### ✨ Have an Idea?

Use our **[feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)** to suggest:

### 🎨 Need a New Icon?

**Icons come from the upstream [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) project.** If you need a new icon:

1. **[Request it upstream](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/issues/new)** in the main Lucide project
2. **[Create a feature request](https://github.com/codegress-com/lucide-rs/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)** here so we can track when it becomes available
3. Once added upstream, it will be included in our next release
